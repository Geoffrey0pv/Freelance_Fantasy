This project is a web application divided into three main parts:

1. **Frontend:** Built with React.
2. **Backend:** Implemented with Django.
3. **Database:** Utilizes PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (for the React frontend)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) and pip (for the Django backend)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for the database)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

## Commands to interact with the database.

  Before run the backend apply those command for load the information on database.
  
- python manage.py create_projects_with_factory
- python manage.py create_test_mileston
- python manage.py create_test_task
- python manage.py create_test_offers
- python manage.py create_test_notifications
- python manage.py create_test_reviews
- python manage.py images

## For selenium testing
  cd src/frontend/frontend/test/selenium/
  
- python test_register.py 
- python test_login.py 
- python test_payment.py 
- python test_notification.py

## For py test
  on backend only put this command
  python manage.py test

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2024-2-PI1-G3/202402-proyecto-myrtille.git
cd 202402-proyecto-myrtille
```

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   ## Use this command only once when you install the project for the first time
   python -m venv venv

   # Run the Python environment
   On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate

   # And then use this command to run server
   python manage.py runserver

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   ## Also use this command only once when you install the project & this command is to install libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1. **Create a database**

   Install postgreSQL & configure the settings file with this information, remember when you're going to create the local database in your host,
   put the name database, the user & the password how Postgresql to have a standard in all repos, this is temporary still the application is still in the developing phase.

   ```plaintext
   DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
          'NAME': 'postgres',
          'USER': 'postgres',
          'PASSWORD': 'postgres',
          'HOST': 'localhost',  # O la IP del servidor de la base de datos
          'PORT': '5432',       # Puerto de PostgreSQL por defecto
      }
   }
   ```

5. **Apply migrations and run the server**

   ```bash
   ## This command is 
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Install Node.js**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which is required to install the project dependencies.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Once you have Node.js installed, navigate to the `frontend` directory of the project and run:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install 
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
   
   Make sure that the `package.json` file includes all the necessary dependencies for the project. If any of these are missing, you can add them by running `npm install <package-name>`.
  
   Hereâ€™s an example of the core dependencies that should be included:
  
   ```bash
    npm install axios
    npm install react
    npm install react-dom
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install three
    npm install react-password-strength-bar
    npm install react-bootstrap
    npm install react-redux
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
   ```
  
    Make sure to update the versions according to your project needs.


4. **Install TAILWIND CSS**

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss
    npx tailwindcss init
    
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**

   After installing the dependencies, start the development server with:

   ```bash
   
   npm run dev
   
   ```

   This will launch the React app in your browser, and it will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the code.


   

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that Node.js is properly installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` to check their versions.
- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and rerunning `npm install`.

This setup will help your teammates quickly install and run the frontend part of the project.
